# Javascript Modules - Browserify
In this project we will use Browserify to compile and bundle our modules.
Because Browserify will bundle all our javascript files on the server before supplying them to the browser, all the dependencies will be managed via npm.

## Set Up application
Run the following commands
```
npm install
gulp dev
```
